# Reverse Polish Notation
# You're given a list of string tokens representing a mathematical expression using Reverse Polish
# Notation. Reverse Polish Notation is a notation where operators come after operands, instead of between
# them. For example 2 4 + would evaluate to 6 .
# Parenthesis are always implicit in Reverse Polish Notation, meaning an expression is evaluated from left to
# right. All of the operators for this problem take two operands, which will always be the two values
# immediately preceding the operator. For example, 18 4 - 7 / would evaluate to ((18 - 4) / 7)
# or 2 .
# Write a function that takes this list of tokens and returns the result. Your function should support four
# operators: + , - , * , and / for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division respectively.
# Division should always be treated as integer division, rounding towards zero. For example, 3 / 2
# evaluates to 1 and -3 / 2 evaluates to -1 . You can assume the input will always be valid Reverse
# Polish Notation, and it will always result in a valid number. Your code should not edit this input list.
# Sample Input
# tokens = ["50", "3", "17", "+", "2", "-", "/"]
# Sample Output
# 2 // (50 / ((3 + 17) - 2)))

def reversePolishNotation(tokens):
    # Write your code here.
    stack = []
    for token in tokens:
        if token == '+':
            stack.append(stack.pop() + stack.pop())
        elif token == '-':
            first = stack.pop()
            stack.append(stack.pop() - first)
        elif token == '*':
            stack.append(stack.pop() * stack.pop())
        elif token == '/':
            first = stack.pop()
            stack.append(int(stack.pop() / first))
        else:
            stack.append(int(token))
    return stack.pop()
